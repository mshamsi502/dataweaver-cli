DataWeaver CLI is a self-contained, cross-platform command-line tool designed to simplify and automate common database tasks, starting with backup and restore operations for MongoDB. It features an easy-to-use interactive menu and a self-updating mechanism for its dependencies.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **MongoDB Backup & Restore**: Easily create compressed backups of your remote MongoDB and restore them to a local instance.
- **Automated Tooling**: The `download-tools` command automatically fetches and installs the necessary MongoDB Database Tools for your platform (currently supports Windows).
- **Interactive Menu**: A user-friendly menu for guided operations, making it easy for anyone to use without memorizing commands.
- **Configuration-Driven**: Manages all settings like connection strings and paths in a simple `config.yaml` file.
- **Portable**: Designed to keep its dependencies in a local project folder, avoiding the need for system-wide installations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: Version 1.20 or higher is required to build from source.
- **PowerShell**: Required on Windows for the automated installer script.

### Installation

You can get DataWeaver CLI in one of two ways:

#### 1. From a Release (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started.

1.  Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dataweaver-cli/releases) page for this project.
2.  Download the appropriate binary for your operating system (e.g., `dataweaver-cli.exe` for Windows).
3.  For Windows, also download the `install_tools.ps1` script and place it in the same directory as the executable.
4.  Run the application from your terminal.

#### 2. From Source (For Developers)

If you have Go installed, you can build the CLI from source.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dataweaver-cli.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dataweaver-cli.git)
    cd dataweaver-cli
    ```
2.  Fetch the dependencies:
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```
3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

## üìñ Usage

Using the tool is a simple, three-step process for the first run.

### Step 1: Download & Install Dependencies

The very first time you run the tool, you need to download the required MongoDB command-line tools. Our CLI automates this for you.

```bash
dataweaver-cli download-tools
```

This will download the tools, and on Windows, it will launch an installer script which will prompt for Administrator privileges to install the tools system-wide and find the installation path automatically.

### Step 2: Configure the CLI
Next, set up your database connection strings and paths. Run the configure command:

```bash
dataweaver-cli configure
```

This will launch an interactive wizard that asks for:

- Remote MongoDB URI: The connection string for the database you want to back up.
- Local MongoDB URI: The connection string for the database where you want to restore backups.
- Backup Path: A local directory where backup files will be stored (e.g., ```./backups```).
- Mongo Tools Path: This is set automatically by the ```download-tools``` command.

### Step 3: Use the Interactive Menu
Now you are all set! Just run the tool without any commands to open the main menu.

```bash
dataweaver-cli
```
You will see a list of options:

- Backup MongoDB
- Restore MongoDB
- Configure Settings
- Download/Setup Tools
- ...and more.

Simply select an option and follow the prompts.

## üïπÔ∏è Command Reference
You can also use commands directly without the interactive menu.
```
dataweaver-cli
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configure              # Configure application settings interactively or with flags.
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ path               # Show the path to the active configuration file.
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ edit               # Open the configuration file in the default editor.
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ download-tools         # Download and set up required dependencies (e.g., MongoDB Tools).
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mongo              # Create a new backup of the remote MongoDB database.
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ restore
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mongo              # Restore a MongoDB database from an existing backup.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The CLI uses a ```config.yaml``` file to store settings. This file is typically located at:

- Windows: ```C:\Users\<YourUser>\.dataweaver-cli\config.yaml```
- Linux/macOS: ```~/.dataweaver-cli/config.yaml```

A typical configuration file looks like this:
```YAML
mongodb:
  local_uri: mongodb://localhost:27017
  remote_uri: mongodb://user:password@remote-host:27017/mydatabase
paths:
  backup: ./backups
  mongo_tools: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Tools\100.12.1\bin
```
## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
This project is actively being developed. Future enhancements include:

- [ ] Support for other databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, QuestDB).
- [ ] Add support for Linux and macOS to the ```download-tools``` command.
- [ ] Add progress bars for long-running operations like downloads and backups.
- [ ] Add more backup management commands (e.g., list, clean old backups).
